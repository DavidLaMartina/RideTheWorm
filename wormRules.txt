                                    Welcome to Ride the Worm!

This game is based on Frank Herbert's 1965 science fiction masterpiece, Dune. You'll play a fremen,
one of the desert people who live in hidden communities called sietches on the planet Arrakis, also
known as Dune. Your goal is to travel from one sietch to the next - but your trek across the harsh
desert will be anything but easy!

Even with your moisture-preserving stillsuit, you can only survive so long without dying of thirst.
However, you'll never make it to your destination in time if you walk the whole way. If you want to
make it there alive, you'll have to ride a worm!

The deserts of Dune are filled with massive sandworms, which live and travel underground. Fremen 
have mastered the art of wormriding, and by riding a worm, you can travel far faster and reach
your destination before you die of thirst.

To make it across the dessert, you'll need a few tools. Your toolkit includes:
    -Thumpers: A thumper will cause any worms within the 5-space square surrounding you to emerge.
               Be carefule, though! If you thump directly on top of a submerged worm, it will
               swallow you whole as it emerges!
    -Spice: The spice melange is the most sought-after substance in the empire, and for good reason!
            By consuming spice, you activate your dormant prescience - the ability to see the unseen.
            If you consume spice during a turn, you will be able to see all worms on the board, both
            submerged and surfaced.
    -Maker hooks: Maker hooks are the tools fremen use to steer worms. You'll have to have at least 
                  one to successfully mount and ride a worm!

    -You'll start each game with 10 maker hooks and 10 thumpers. Those, along with your thirst
     counter, will be replenished when you arrive at the next sietch. Spice you'll have to find!

Here are a few other things to keep in mind as you make your way across the dessert:
    -Every step you take across sand or onto a worm will cause your thirst counter to decrease by 1.
    -Every time you walk across sand (or a submerged worm, which looks like sand), there is a chance
     that you'll find spice, which will be placed into your inventory.
    -The map is littered with Creosote bushes - plants that retain moisture. If you move onto a bush,
     your thirst counter will increase by 1. They can be real life-savers!
    -You may only ride a worm once your thumper has caused it to surface! Once you mount (move onto) 
     a worm segment, you'll be able to choose to move up to 10 TOTAL  spaces in up to 2 different 
     directions.
    -Surfaced worms STAY surfaced until the end of a turn.
    -Once activated, prescience remains activated until the end of a turn.

Here are the things that will occur during every move of every turn - and every turn includes 5 moves.
    -You'll have the chance to use spice, if it's in your inventory.
    -You'll have the chance to use a thumper.
    -You'll be able to move one space. If you move onto a surfaced worm segment, you'll get to ride!

Remember, your goal is to get from one sietch to the other! There is a safe perimeter around each
sietch, which worms can't enter, but you must arrive at the sietch - marked by an S - to win.

Overall, your goal is to complete as many successful journies as possible without dying, either of
thirst or being swallowed by a sandworm.

Safe travels!
